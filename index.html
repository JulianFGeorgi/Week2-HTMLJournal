    <h1>My College Experience</h1>
    <p>
        During my time in college, I've been exposed to a diverse range of subjects and experiences that have broadened my perspective on the world. I've enjoyed my time so far in <i>COMD</i> and i cant wait to have a career in this major. As I progress through the semesters, I'm excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and eager to apply my skills in a meaningful way.
    </p>
    <p>
        After graduation, I aspire to pursue a career in <em>graphic design</em> where I can contribute to innovative ideas and concepts and take them to another level.
